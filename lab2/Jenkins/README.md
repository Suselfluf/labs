# Jenkins

## Desctiption

Jenkiks
: is an open source automation server enabling users to reliably build, test and deploy the software.

## Purpose and benefits in the DevOps context

- First clear advantage of using Jenkins is commonly shared plugins marketplace, where everyone can contribute their own plugin or download existing ones. Plugins already provide ready to use functionality under the hood.
- Jenkins allows users to set hosting options within different usecases.
- jenkins also is open to be combined with different CI/CD platforms, however it can perform alone.

## Key features and functionalities

1. Developers contribute cahnges to the source code, stored within the repository.
2. Regular availability checking is enabled by the server itself.
3. The build server builds code into an executable file, where failing leeds to imidiate feedback to developers.
4. Master-Slave architecture. Jenkins accesses the master repository with an opportunity to break down root repo into multiple slave repositories to distribute the workload. That in the same time allows us to run multiple instances of builds, tests and product environments.

Jenkins helps to automate and accelerate the software development process with following list of applciations:

- By increasing code coverage.
- No broken code. Jenkins ensures that the code is good and tested through continuous integration.

## Use cases and examples

1. Jenkins can be integrated within the team, having the repository on Github, so having webhooks with Jenkins each commit will be verified by Jenkins and informed with corresponding results to the development team.
2. The Jenkins platform will let the merchant have several code base branches and work on various projects in simultaneously. This will make building in many contexts easier and lower the risk.
