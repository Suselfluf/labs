# Task 1: Artifact Registries Research

# Amazon Web Services (AWS)

### Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)

- A Docker container registry that is completely controlled.

- For container deployment, seamlessly interfaces with Amazon ECS and EKS.

- Has monitoring integration with Amazon CloudWatch.

- Supports images for Docker containers.

### AWS CodeArtifact

- An artifact repository that provides managed artifacts for software. works with well-liked package managers like as npm, Maven, and pip for Python.
- Enables package sharing between AWS accounts.

## Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

### Google Container Registry

- A Google Cloud private container image storage service.
- For container orchestration, smoothly integrates with Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).
- For better availability and quicker image retrieval, use global replication.

### Google Artifact Registry

- Supports hosting, management, and container image hosting of software packages.
- Options for regional and multi-regional data replication.

## Microsoft Azure

### Azure Container Registry

- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and other Azure services are smoothly integrated with this fully managed private container registry.
- supports Helm charts and Docker images.
- Offers geo-replication for increased performance and availability.
- Provides Azure Active Directory-based authentication and authorization.

### Azure Artifacts

- A service that hosts all software artifacts as packages. works with well-known package managers like Maven, NuGet, and npm.
- enables package sharing between projects and organizations.

## Task 2: Serverless Computing Platform Research

## Amazon Web Services (AWS)

### AWS Lambda

- A serverless compute service that is fully managed.
- Accommodates a variety of programming languages.
- Scales automatically dependent on the volume of incoming requests.
- Only pay for the computation time used.
