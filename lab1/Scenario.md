## Task 2: Apply DevOps Practices in a Scenario


### __Context__

A company N conducting web applications development for a short period of time on the market has been always suffering from a delays within the development cycles, what in sequence sometimes affected the final result of the application, since they could not do that on time. Organization incount 20 developers doing all the development routine mostly manually. Product manager himslef also takes participant within the development process as a developer.  

### DevOps practives to apply

1. Since the context has defined high load on product manager within the development process it is possible to adress the enhancing feedback connection with the customers, since the team will recieve regular feedback with insides that will help to understand what should be done and improved within the application more frequently, which in sequence will reduce the time involved in fixing the mistakes, percieved with the feedback.
2. Automation pipelines for both testing and development cycles will reduce manuall work of developers, which in sequence will help to spot defects in the codebase, will help to push changes automatically saving time for the rest of activities and will help to track important metrics such as **Lead time for changes** or **Deployment frequency**, which will help to track how often code is deployed to staging, testing, or production or time taken for a commit to go into production measurement, grounding on which it is possible to make important conclusiions. 
3. Having metrics from previous decision giving another suggestion with monitoring and measuring appropriate metrics  practices. As that was described before it is possible to spot issues with the development process in early stages of each cycle so the team will be able to manage some changes to promote silly aspect to get back on track. Having such practice in bag will help to manage time resources more effectively, what is the game changer in the context described with the current research.
