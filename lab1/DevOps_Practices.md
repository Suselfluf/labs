# Introduction to DevOps

## Task 1: Research and Define DevOps Principles and Practices
Here is the list of key principles and practices within the DevOps workfield from my perspective of view.

1. Both @Atlassian and @GitLab claims Colloboration and Communication enhancing premisses as one of the core principles of the DevOps workflow. I do personally agree with that concept since most of the development methodologies proven in the effectiveness of use after years and many success stories palced at the head the importance of close communication between different kind of stakeholders to ensure continuous feedback and the absence of colloboration blockers. 
As an usecase example it is possible to refer into the following image, visualizing Agile DevOps lifecycle where each of development team has continious feedback flows with an opportunity to share common knowledge field between each of  working environments.

Absence of such communication flows will significantly affect the performance of the development team due to long delays in communication, which in sequence could damage time to market measure. 

2. Automation of the software development lifecycle
Both my personal experience and sources (@Atlassian and @GitLab) mention automation premises as must-to-have principle. The reason for this can be simple and very helpful in the same time since all development aspects requires ton of manual work to enhance the regular pipeline of development, testing and code management practices. Today's big companies releases code many times per day so manual work without any doubts will delay development process repeatedly. This way automation as a key element of CI/CD pipeline helps to reduce human erros and increase productivity of sotware development processes as a whole.

As an use-case example it is possible to refer to daily routine of backend developers who regularly push changes into development environment of the codebase, unfortunately sometimes it is not possible to spot the bug affecting the front-end performance side, so it might come to surface later, having automation pipeline in the codebase might catch some of that kid of issues and prevent unexpected surprices in the future.

3. High attention to the feedback sessions and loops centring around customer is another essential principle in DevOps segment. Refering back to @Atlassian, @GitLab and @Unity ensure on the importance building close connections around the customers opinion and reflection and there is a reasons for it. Customers are the final users of the software beeing developed by the company so it is important to understand what does end user really want to see in the applicaiton. Having continuous and short acces to the customer feedback it is possible to have a clear vision on what do users see and what do they expect to have. Quick access to the feedback provieds important insides, which should be improoved or updated with upcomming iterations.

It is a common mistake in modern life when development team did not listen for the customer's feedback so they might can build a product, but it won't meet the need of the end user. 

4. Monitoring and measuring appropriate metrics will save significant amount of affort to deliver the product. Timely observation for different metrics can say what aspect of process should be improoved to get back on track or to enhance the performance of the team as a whole. **Logging, **monitoring, **alerting and **tracking are included in that kind of principle. Having all necessary KPIs metrics nearby will help to handle and manage the direction and develeopment flow.

As a real-world use case example it is possible to refer to our's industrial project previous semester sprint where we did have actively updating burdown chart in the ClickUp management tool so we were able to notice that we were late with planned results so we got alerted on time and were able to conduct the deployment on the time. 

## Task 2: Apply DevOps Practices in a Scenario

To earn an additional 4 points and further demonstrate your understanding of DevOps principles and practices, complete the following tasks:

1. Create a file named `Scenario.md` in the `lab1` folder.
2. Invent a fictional scenario where a software development team encounters challenges that can be addressed by applying DevOps principles and practices.
3. Describe the scenario in the `Scenario.md` file, including the specific challenges and the potential benefits of applying DevOps principles and practices.
4. Identify at least three DevOps practices from Task 1 that can be applied to address the challenges in the scenario.
5. For each identified principle, provide a detailed explanation of how it can help overcome the challenges and achieve the desired outcomes.
6. Don't copy-paste, please use your own words. A short and simple answer is sufficient.
7. Use clear and concise language to convey your ideas effectively.

Remember to include your report and files in the same folder as the lab assignment. Create a Pull Request to the main branch of the repository when you have completed the tasks. Ensure that you follow the instructions provided by your instructor for the specific lab assignment.
