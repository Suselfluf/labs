## Task 1

### Defenition

Software distribution - is a process of delivering software from a developer to the end user. Significance is within the compexity of sharing the software throughout the community to make as mcuh as possible common user experience dispite the variety of OS between different users groups.

### Distribution strategies

A distribution strategy is a considered method of getting goods and services to end-users with the end goal of maximizing revenue and customer loyalty.

There is a few of different strategies:

- Direct distribution
  Direct distribution refers to selling your products directly to customers without any need for a middleman.
- Indirect distribution

- Selective distribution

### Best practices for software distribution

1. Data-driven approach
   Once you are clear on your goals, you can begin to consider how to measure success.
   In the real world, a quantitative approach to manufacturing unlocked new levels of production, and software is no exception.
2. Using Agile methodologies.
   You become more responsive to your consumers when you have manageable, quantifiable goals that you can iterate on rapidly. Software delivery is a continuous process, and feedback shouldn't be saved till the end.
3. Source control processes
   Your branching, code review, and merge decisions will have an impact on everything downstream of source control. The possibility of merge conflicts and other logistical problems increases when more software engineers interact with a particular source.
